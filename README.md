## Run `app.py`
```python
pip intall -r requirements.txt
```
```python
python app.py
```

It will open up an minimilistic flask web-app that serves the excel sheet live while also updating the local saved ones.

## Accessing the [web-app](https://crypto-data-analyzer.onrender.com/):
Just click the link and wait for a while. Since the service is hosted on render, it can take some time for the site to fully load up.
